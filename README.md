# horseshoe_demog

In this repo I mainly do an SMC historical demography analysis on data from a single horseshoe crab genome assembly. for the assembly there are five ONT runs: 3 minion runs and 2 promethion runs. For the SMC analysis I rebasecall and use data from only the two promethion runs. 

I also do some exploratory analysis using a low coverage genetic mapping dataset.
